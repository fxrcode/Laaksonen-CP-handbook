# Chap 5: Complete Search

## Pruning the search
- for grid path: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1625/
    - What I learned is that 2d array as on_path is way faster than map
    - C++ is about 10x faster than Python3
        - C++ 0.03s vs 16.78s (201), 0.26s vs 300s (88418)
        - Python3 0.19s vs 19.38s (201), 2.64s vs 297.71s (88418)
